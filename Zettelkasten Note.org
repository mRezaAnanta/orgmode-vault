:END:

- competency is a noticeable and recognizable output of work by the employee
- The employee is getting promoted or not because of his competence
- once getting promoted or moved to a different job with different requirements he might not look as competent as before
- the company/organisation must provide adequate skill training for those who were promoted or moved to a different job
